Hello, I’m @zhangms1709

"There is but one solution to the intricate riddle of life; to improve ourselves, and contribute to the happiness of others." - Mary Shelley

Background facts:
- I’m interested in philosophy and computer science
- I specialize in Kantian moral philosophy and Plato on one hand, and Machine Learning and UI/UX on the other hand
- I work on projects with big data and supervised learning under [Avi Ma'ayan](https://labs.icahn.mssm.edu/maayanlab/) and [Steven P. Brady](http://bradylab.weebly.com/) in the past
